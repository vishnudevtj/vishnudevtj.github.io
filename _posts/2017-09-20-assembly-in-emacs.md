# Assembly in Emacs

Learning Assembly is essential to Reverse Engineer among other stuffs , Well I write my code in Emacs and it contains asm mode, which helps in Assembly programming. But I need documentation in my finger tip , something like company mode which is really help full while coding . This is emacs, isn't there some code lying in the internet which will help , So i Searched the internet and with no surprise there is a package for x86 architecture called [x86-lookup](https://github.com/skeeto/x86-lookup) , it opens the intel developer manual in a document viewer or in emacs's pdf viewer . It basically works by first converting the pdf to text and indexing it and later searches the index and opens up the correct page . Same author have made a [nasm mode](https://github.com/skeeto/nasm-mode) for nasm programming .

```emacs-lisp
(use-package x86-lookup
  :ensure t
  :config
  (setq  x86-lookup-pdf "~/Dropbox/Books/Hacking/64-iA32-Instruction-set-reference-vol2.pdf")
  )
(use-package nasm-mode
  :ensure t
  :config
  (add-hook 'asm-mode-hook 'nasm-mode)
  )
```

Dependencies :

```sh
sudo apt install poppler-utils
```
