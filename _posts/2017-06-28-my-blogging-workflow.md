# Emacs Blog Workflow

Blogging with jekyll and org mode cloning the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vishnudevtj/vishnudevtj.github.io.git
```

I keep a note.org file which contains all my notes , also have a org capture for note which inserts the notes . When i need to post my note as a blog . The required region is selected , and it is exported with [ox-gfm](https://github.com/larstvei/ox-gfm) exporter , since jekyll uses the github flavoured Markdown . Using the [Yasnippet](http://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet) , the front matter of the post is inserted

this snippet insets the title [from the file name] and update time

Jekyll is installed using Docker

```sh
docker pull jekyll/jekyll
```

There is a cool package for emacs called [Prodigy](https://github.com/rejeep/prodigy.el) which is used to manage external services .

So prodigy is used to fire up the docker container . [Magit](https://magit.vc/) is used to upload the changes to github
